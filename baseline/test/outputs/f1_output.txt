***Query: Who can do part-time studies at Bamberg？How many courses would I need to take each semester, and do I still have to pay the full fees?
***Answer: Who can benefit: Particularly for students with children, part-time employment or students with disabilities or chronic illness, part-time studies afford the opportunity to reduce these students’ academic work load during the semester and extend the allotted duration of a particular degree programme. Course load adjustment: The required academic course load per semester is accordingly reduced by half. Semester fees: Students are obliged to pay the complete fees (the so-called ‘Semesterbeitrag’, which consists of a contribution to the student union and the fees for a semester public transport ticket).
***Generated Answer: Part-time Studies at Bamberg can be done by anyone who has completed the part-time degree programme previously attended. To calculate the required academic course load per semester, you need to divide the number of credits by 2. This means that you would need to take 1/2 as many courses each semester and pay the full semester fees. However, if you have children, part-time employment or disabilities or chronic illness, you may be eligible for reduced course loads, but this is determined on a case-by-case basis by the faculty and may result in slightly fewer courses being taken per semester. It's important to note that students are obliged to pay the complete fees, which consists of a contribution to the student union.
