Wide range of subjects through five chairs in the field of applied computer science and five chairs in the field of computer science are provided. Extensive electronic learning platform is offered, where the course materials for the individual courses are made available. This forum can be used to put questions to fellow students and lecturers and to hold discussions on individual topics. We have good contacts among the students and active student groups and associations, which makes everyday student life easier. Interdisciplinary approach through the application of computer science to areas of humanities, cultural and social sciences creates generalists with a vision. The World Heritage City of Bamberg offers something for every taste, both in terms of leisure activities and culture. Thanks to the interdisciplinary approach of this applied course, the graduates have very good job market opportunities. "
